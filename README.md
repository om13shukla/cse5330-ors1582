## Project-2.

    1. - *NoSQL DataBase: MongoDB 
            ===> Everything else is in JSON why not Database too!
    2. - General Aspects: Comfortable
            ===> Completeing this project was fun, little less challenging. Although configuring 
                    and deploying on cloud environment 
                 was little tricky and strict.
            ===> Working with Angular animation is satisfying, able to see every tiny changes 
                    ypu make is fun too.
            
    3. - NodeJS would be my biggest concern. Understanding middlewares, callbacks, and the 
                error handling on top of Express especially is tougher then it seems at first.
                Lot of unkown terretory. Although given a time, would be easy to master.

## Qestionnaire :

  1. What server framework did you choose and why?  
          ==>The Web page is created using NODE.JS server framework, Because Given the requirements of the Project being single page,
             Node.js seemed good choice.
     
  2.What client framework did you choose and why?  
        ==>Angular.JS is the client Framework used in this project. Manipulating DOM and making AJAX style calls can be done in Angular         very easily, Especially the two way binding of elements to the data was main driving reason to select Angular.JS
